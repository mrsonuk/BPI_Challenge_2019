#### About the challenge:
[BPI 2019 challenge](https://icpmconference.org/icpm-2019/contests-challenges/bpi-challenge-2019/) provides participants with a real-life event log, and challenges them to analyze these data using whatever techniques available, focusing on one or more of the process ownerâ€™s questions or proving other unique insights into the process(es) captured in the event log. Data for this challenge is collected data from a large multinational company operating from The Netherlands in the area of coatings and paints and  participants to investigate the purchase order handling process for some of its 60 subsidiaries.




#### Challenge Questions: 
###### Questions to Answer

The company is interested in answers to three main questions:

- [ ] Is there a collection of process models which together properly describe the process in this data. Based on the four categories above, at least 4 models are needed, but any collection of models that together explain the process well is appreciated. Preferably, the decision which model explains which purchase item best is based on properties of the item.
- [ ] What is the throughput of the invoicing process, i.e. the time between goods receipt, invoice receipt and payment (clear invoice)? To answer this, a technique is sought to match these events within a line item, i.e. if there are multiple goods receipt messages and multiple invoices within a line item, how are they related and which belong together?
- [ ] Finally, which Purchase Documents stand out from the log? Where are deviations from the processes discovered in (1) and how severe are these deviations? Deviations may be according to the prescribed high-level process flow, but also with respect to the values of the invoices. Which customers produce a lot of rework as invoices are wrong, etc.?
